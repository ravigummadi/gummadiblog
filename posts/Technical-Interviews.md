The first time ever I interviewed was in early 2006, when companies flocked our campus (BITS Pilani) to hire us. I thought I had it easy, there were more companies than total number of CS students, I was reasonable adept at (only!) programming (at least my peers made me believe so). During the previous semester, I did go through some puzzles (brain teasers) and CLRS (Cormen). Then the reality slowly settled in. Google didn’t allow me to take the test because my GPA is not high enough and I didn't clear Microsoft written test. I had a string of rejects. I wasn’t sure why, because the semester before during my internship - I got accolades from my all colleagues how my performance was beyond the expectations of any intern. So I was reasonably confident that, I am good at programming (based on my grades in CS courses) and I can do well in a professional setting. That stinked. It slowly started settling in that doing well in interviews is not a realistic measure of how well you perform in job or school. This post evolved over a decade of my experience interviewing over 30 onsite interviews and countless phone interviews.

But it is hard to not take a rejection personally. And a string of rejects will lead you to question if you are good enough and hurt the morale (as though we needed more reasons for imposter syndrome). I have seen even accomplished and senior engineers whom I work with go through this. 

# Tips for Interview Preparation

* Give a lot of interviews. There is no shortcut for hard earned experience. In this process you will get used to a lot of rejects. 
* Give interviews when you are professionally and personally in a happy place. Otherwise you run the risk of conflating the failures in interviews to other aspects of your life.  
* Have a counter offer. Having an offer which you are willing to take, if you don’t get the job exponentially boosts your confidence going into the interview. 
* Finally have fun and eat well. I know this runs counter to some of the advice online, but have a good lunch. Interviewing drains a lot of energy and its important to keep your carb count up! :)

# Types of Technical Interviews and how to prepare for them

## Design questions

## Writing a program in an IDE

## Puzzles (Brain teasers)

# This [Type] Interviewing Sucks

As elicited in the introduction, for any of the above type of interviews you can make an argument for or against on why a particular interview type sucks (Hacker News is filled with book length worth of comments debating this!). This is the case with most type of examinations, like SAT and EAMCET/IIT (In India).  You can either fight the system or play by the rules. Most of these practices have been entrenched in tech industry for decades (starting during the days of early Microsoft). Think of the probability of your 1000-word rant changing the company’s interview process versus you going through the preparation and getting a job. 

# How to schedule your interviews 
Slot the companies you are most likely to accept an offer from into three categories. Extremely likely (A+): You will accept in offer from these companies without second thought. 
Likely (A): You will accept this offer, if you don’t get an offer from one of the A+ company.
Not likely (A-): Your current job is probably better than this and you will not regret if you have to say No to this company. 

**Offer Scale:** A+ > A > Current Job > A-

**Steps:**
	
 1. Give interviews to A- companies and probably get an offer or two. Don’t haggle about the compensation or other trivialities too much here. That’s not the goal. Getting practice and confidence is. 
 2. Once you are reasonably comfortable with the interviewing, try giving one of the company in A+, which has notoriously hard interviews. You will most likely fail that interview and that’s the point of it. 
 3. The A/A+ seesaw: Start with the A companies and schedule your interviews. Ideally, if you get an offer from A, call one of those A+ recruiters and try to get the initial screening waived off. If you get an offer from A+, negotiate based on your existing offers and accept the A+ offer. 
 4. (If no offer) Wait for 12-18 months, repeat from Step 1. 

# Coding Competitions

> Personally, I've never been tempted to program competitively.  I write programs to solve problems, not to demonstrate that I'm better than someone else at programming or problem solving.  That said, I'm fine with others who program competitively; just because I'm not personally  interested in it doesn't mean that nobody else should do it.
> 
> My analogy would be to competitive cooking shows, such as the Food Network shows seemingly all the time.  When I watch competitive cooking shows, I don't care who wins.  I watch to pick up ideas and to see people being creative.  That's how I feel about competitive programming.  I don't care who wins; I just like to see people being creative.

This is not to say that there is no advantage in participating it. If you are passionate about them and have spare time, please participate and it will be a huge advantage. But if you don't, that is not a deal breaker. You can still practice well the practice questions listed in one of the above resources and crack the interview. Also remember that most of the questions posted in programming competitions (other than the really basic ones) are tough to solve in a 45 minute slot. 

# Luck

One final word about luck. Yes, it plays a part as everything else in life. In interviewing, if you are confident that you screwed up in an interview - you will not get an offer. On the other hand, even if you are confident that you answered everything perfectly - you *might* still not get an offer. Here are two ends of luck spectrum. I have seen cases for the “Extremely unlucky” end of spectrum, but yet to see one who is “Extremely lucky”.

* **Extremely lucky** -- Read and practiced just 5 coding questions before the interview day and she gets asked the same set of questions with no or little follow up questions. 
* **Extremely unlucky** -- Candidate has gone through all the practice questions in various websites and books multiple times, put in months of practice. She got a bad rating due to an interviewer having a bad day and hell bent on making the candidate’s life hard (This happens!).
